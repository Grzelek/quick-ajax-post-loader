== Changelog ==

= 1.1.1 = 2024-08-02 =
- Optimized script loading to only load `quick-ajax-script` on the frontend, improving performance and avoiding unnecessary loading in the admin area.

= 1.1 = 2024-08-01 =
- Improved Template File Overriding Hierarchy: Updated the template file search and merge mechanism to ensure that files from the child theme take precedence over those from the parent theme and the plugin. Introduced a mapping of file names to their paths, allowing only the most recent versions of template files to be retained.
- Optimized Template File Search: Enhanced the `find_template_files` function to utilize `glob` for handling search patterns. This allows for efficient searching of template files matching specific patterns.
- Adopted Recommended Functions for JSON Data Handling: Replaced direct calls to `json_encode` with `wp_json_encode` in accordance with WordPress standards, improving compatibility and security of JSON data.
- Safer File Operations: Replaced the use of `fopen` with the WordPress Filesystem API, using `WP_Filesystem` for file operations. This ensures greater compatibility with different hosting configurations and enhances security.
- Enhanced Output Security: All outputs generated by `wp_trim_excerpt` and `__` functions have been properly secured using functions like `esc_html` or `wp_kses`, ensuring compliance with WordPress security guidelines and protection against potential XSS attacks.
- Optimized Code Structure: Enhanced code performance and maintainability through structured optimizations.
- Improved Security Measures: Strengthened security protocols and addressed vulnerabilities to bolster code safety.
- Support for new shortcode attributes: `post_type`, `posts_per_page`, `order`, `orderby`, and `post_status`. These attributes can now be set through shortcode parameters.
- Added 'Ignore Sticky Posts' Option: Introduced a new option to the plugin settings that allows users to ignore sticky posts in the WP_Query.
